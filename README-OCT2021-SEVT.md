### Lab Topology
To access the lab, you will need to use a Remote Desktop connection to the specific jump host.  The jump host is used to allow remotes access into all lab devices within the given pod envrionment.

Please refer to the IOS XE Programambility Lab Acess Sheet for specific pod access instructions and details

## Modules

# Day 0 - Guest Shell, Guest Share

The Guestshell Linux container within IOS XE is a CentOS 8 based operating system available that is integrated and available for programmability and automation use cases. In this simple example the container will be enabled and the shared folder between IOS XE and the Guest Shell will be explored.

# Day 2 - gRPC Model Driven Telemetry + TLS

The Day 2 gRPC Model Driven Telemetry with TLS module covers gRPC telemetry being secured with TLS certificates between the IOS XE switch and the Telegraf collector, so it is sent securely over the network.

# Day N - gNOI cert.proto Certificate Management API

The Day N gNOI cert.proto "certificate management API" is used to install TLS certificate into IOS XE from the Linux/Ubuntu tooling machine. Once the certificates are loaded some tooling is used to validate the secure connection. gNOI cert.proto is also used in the "Day 2 gRPC-TLS" module to load the certificate to secure the telemetry connection.
